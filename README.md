Initial structure was created with index.html; header,search area, and basic layout for current weather and future weather using core html and library(bootstrap). minimal style.css was used.
Two set of API were created with guideline from the openweathermap.org.(one for current weather and one for future weather)
after data`s were gather and populated on webpage the the icon was added that represent the weather conditon. 
The UV index was then set to diplay how severe the exposure is at the moment; green for less harmful exposure, orange for maderate and red for severe.
The time and date was added using moment js.
Once data from search city was saved to local storage and display dynamically on webpage a click function was added to search for the saved city. 
A button was added to clear the saved city if users wanted to clear it.
